### About Me

Hey, I’m Nivedita! I’m a third-year Computer Science + Linguistics major at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. In the summer of 2024, I interned with Johnson & Johnson’s CPP group under the Janssen Innovative Medicine sector in San Diego, CA. Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher in the HDCL Group, working on RADWear and Wear Study projects to design models that use wearable sensors to detect stress and anxiety. I also serve as a copy-editor for the ILSURJ. My interests lie at the intersection of generative models in computational neuroscience and natural language understanding. I’m also passionate about guavas, cats, and being near any body of water.

More updates coming soon!
