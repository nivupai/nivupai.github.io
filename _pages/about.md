### About Me

I’m a Computer Science, Linguistics, and Mathematics major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This summer, I interned with Johnson & Johnson’s CPP group under the Janssen Innovative Medicine sector in San Diego, CA. Currently, I'm an undergraduate researcher in the HDCL Group, working on RADWear and Wear Study projects to design models that use wearable sensors to detect stress and anxiety. I also serve as a copy-editor for the ILSURJ. My interests lie at the intersection of generative models in computational neuroscience and natural language understanding. Some of my passions include Susan Sontag, Bharatanatyam, guavas, cats, and being by any body of water.

More updates coming soon!
